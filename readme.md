### Description
It is annoying having to `cd` back to a project directory every time a terminal session is created.
These are a couple of scripts which make that faster and easier.

### Installation (*nix systems only)
run `sudo ./install.sh`

### Usage
run `sexit` to save the working directory of a terminal session into the ~/.bash_session file
run `sresume` to pick up where you left off

### Uninstallation
run `sudo ./uninstall.sh`
